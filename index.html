      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been a graphic designer for many many years. I worked for Nationwide Insurance as a interactive communications manager way back in the 90's 
      when most people still have dial-up. <br />
      Yes, I'm that old. <br />In 2005 I started a non-profit working with schools. COVID practically put us out of business, and even though we are 
      starting to be allowed back on campus, I'm honing my programming skills to give myself more options if I need to become marketable again. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from Iceland, but have live in Columbus, Ohio since 1982. I became a U.S. citizen in 2005 and now have dual citizenship.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am an avid reader and have recently become a gardener. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I pretty much had a dream job Until Covid put us out of business. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Up until March 2020, I lived in Columus, OH from April - October and in New Smyrna Beach, Florida in the winter. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am designing a school fundraising website  in React.js for our non-profit and want to learn the backend of programming. </p>
